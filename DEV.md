## DESIGN
- `SimulationConfiguration` class --> general container that stores configuration stuff
    - Can be saved to settings
    - General things, like "prioritize X abilities", "auto-discover multi-attack", "use items", etc.
    - Resource Usage
        - None (do not use spell slots, class resources)
        - Low (2 spell slots of {max spell slot lvl / 3} rounded up, {max class resources / 3} rounded up)
        - Medium (4 spell slots of {max spell slot lvl / 2} rounded up, {max class resources / 2} rounded up)
        - High (all spell slots, all class resources)
- `ActorConfiguration` class --> stores information about how a specific actor should behave
    - Prioritize X ability over Y ability
    - Give the ability to predetermine an order of abilities to use each turn
    - Specify which resources to allocate for the battle
    - Fields
        - abilities[] --> an array of `AbilityConfigurations`
            - Should be ordered by priority at some point
            - On this actor's turn, grab the abilities[] (ordered via the actionsStrategy) and perform them from the top down, if possible
        - defaultAbilityId/index --> (when defined) when in doubt, falls back to this ability (tries to find highest DPS resource-less ability by default)
        - locationStrategy --> which location strategy to use
        - actionsStrategy --> which actions strategy to use
            - Use this to determine the order that the abilities[] field returns available abilities in
    - Combat Strategy Templates
        - Location (sliders?)
            - Ranged (stays on outskirts of battle)
            - Melee (goes where the battle is most fierce)
            - Skirmisher (wades in and out of battle)
        - Actions
            - Striker (prioritizes single-target damage)
            - Nuker (prioritizes AoE damage)
            - Controller (prioritizes debuffs/area control)
            - Support (prioritizes buffs/heals)
        - Resource Usage
            - Inherit (use the general configuration settings)
            - None (do not use spell slots, class resources)
            - Low ({max slots / 3} spell slots of {max spell slot lvl / 3} rounded up, {max class resources / 3} rounded up)
            - Medium ({max slots / 2} spell slots of {max spell slot lvl / 2} rounded up, {max class resources / 2} rounded up)
            - High (all spell slots, all class resources)
            - Custom (specify which resources and class abilities to use, and how much of them to use)
- `AbilityConfiguration` class --> keeps track of the ability and when to use it
    - Fields
        - resourceConfiguration --> a `AbilityResourceConfiguration` for that ability
- `AbilityResourceConfiguration` class (or just interface/type) --> stores information about how a resource should be used
    - resourceId --> id of the resource (primary, secondary, spell slot, feature id, etc.)
    - resourceMax --> the maximum value of the resource
    - numberOfUsableResources --> number of resources that can be used in this combat
